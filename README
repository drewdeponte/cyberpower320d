What Is It?
-----------
	cyberpower320d is a UPS monitor specificly written for the
	CyberPower 320SL UPS. Despite the fact that it is written
	specificaly for one UPS it has been know to work on other
	UPSs such as CyberPower Power99 and Power2000 UPSs. If
	you find that it works on your ups and it isn't listed
	above please notify me at cyphactor@@socal.rr.com.

How It Works!
-------------
	Basically what happens is that the UPS notifies the box(comp)
	when it enters one of its three states(Power OK, Power FAIL, and
	Power LOW). Power OK is when the UPS is running and being charged.
	Power FAIL is when the UPS battery is what is running everything
	and the UPS is not being charged. Power LOW is when the UPS
	hasn't returned to Power OK state and it is running out of
	battery life. When the Power LOW state is hit, cyberpower320d
	will execute the specified shut down script(look below in the
	Program Usage section). If it hits Power fail state but still
	has a lot of battery life it will print a message saying POWER FAILING.
	This would be a good time to save all files currently being worked on
	because soon enough it will enter Power LOW state and execute the
	shutdown script and you wont have a chance to save your work.
	In many cases the power will be restored before your UPS enters
	Power LOW state and cyberpower320d will react by printing a message
	saying POWER RESTORED to notify you that it is no longer running
	on the battery and that the battery is being charged. Thats about
	it, if you have any questions pleace e-mail me at CyPhAcToR@@socal.rr.com

Install
-------
	Read the INSTALL file.

Program Usage
-------------
	cyberpower320d <serial port> <shutdown script> &
	cyberpower320d requires 2 arguments be passed to it.
	1.) <serial port>
	2.) <shutdown script>

	<serial port> should be replaced with the value of the serial port.
	On most linux machines it is either /dev/ttyS0 or /dev/ttyS1.
	On most OpenBSD machines it is either /dev/cua00 or /dev/cua01.

	<shutdown script> should be replace with the string that you want to
	be executed when the UPS is running out of battery juice.
	This is usually some form of shutdown or halt.
	I suggest reading your man pages for shutdown and halt, decide
	which one you want to use and decide which arguments you want to
	use and then replace <shutdown script> with it.
	Personally I use "/sbin/shutdown -h now" on my linux box and
	"/sbin/shutdown -h -p now" on my OpenBSD box.

	Example:
	(Linux)
	$ ./cyberpower320d /dev/ttyS0 "/sbin/shutdown -h now" &
	(OpenBSD)
	$ ./cyberpower320d /dev/cua00 "/sbin/shutdown -h -p now" &

Insert in rc.local file
-----------------------
	If you do not want to execute the aboce each time you re-boot
	you can just add the above example to your rc.local file which
	is in /etc/rc.d/ on my Linux box and /etc/ on my OpenBSD box.
	
	Example:
	(rc.local start)
	....
	....
	....
	....
	${INSTALLDIR}/${BIN} /dev/ttyS0 "/sbin/shutdown -h now" &
	(rc.local end)

	Obviously replace the ${INSTALLDIR} and ${BIN} with the
	corrisponding info from the Makefile.
